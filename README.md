# backend-basics

This github is part of a [Medium article](https://medium.com/@guilhermehuther/back-end-basics-e9a2ed1f244a) that aims to contribue with the kwonledge of a small portion of the back-end development: RESTful API in node.js with a Postgres Database deployed in AWS.

I recommend to follow the article tutorial before clonning and using this repo.

There's a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) version of this implementation in another [branch](https://github.com/guilhermehuther/backend-basics/tree/fastapi).
