# backend-basics

This github is part of a [medium article](https://medium.com/@guilhermehuther/back-end-basics-e9a2ed1f244a) that aims to contribue with the kwonledge of a small portion of the back-end development: RESTful API in node.js with a Postgres Database deployed in AWS.

I recommend to follow the article tutorial before clonning and using this repo.
